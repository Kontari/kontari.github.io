HTB writeups and a really cool looking github pages. Often uses tools not allowed on the OSCP which highlights that these boxes really are possible if you just try harder.

# Active Directory Changes
There is a [learning path on HTB](https://app.hackthebox.com/tracks/Active-Directory-101) which is a great starting point. Note that i'm leaving out the hard/insane boxes as it's out of scope for the OSCP.
